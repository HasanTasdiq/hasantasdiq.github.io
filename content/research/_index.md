## Research Interests
My research centers on Quantum Network Routing and Resource Scheduling. I design intelligent control planes that utilize Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate physical constraints like fidelity decay and entanglement swapping. By moving beyond static routing methodologies, I develop dynamic, fidelity-aware algorithms that enable scalable, multi-request pathfinding for the future Quantum Internet. A few of my specific interests include:

- Routing and Resource scheduling in Quantum Networks
- Deployment of Quantum Networks
- Distributed Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

## Past Projects
- **QuRA: Reinforcement Learning Based Routing:**: A fidelity-aware routing algorithm using Deep Q-Learning to optimize entanglement distribution in quantum networks, achieving up to 90% higher success rates than traditional methods.

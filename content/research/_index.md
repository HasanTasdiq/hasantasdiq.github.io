## Research Interests
I’m currently exploring Large Language Models (LLMs), AI, and Edge Computing -- figuring out how to make AI smarter, faster, and more efficient on edge devices. My work focuses on bringing powerful AI models closer to where they’re needed, so they can run efficiently outside the cloud. A few of my specific interests include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Edge Deployment and Inference Optimization
- Edge AI
- AI Acceleration

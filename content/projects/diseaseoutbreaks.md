# Socioeconomic Factors and Global Disease Outbreaks
_Paper accepted at the Proceedings of the 5th ACM SIGCAS/SIGCHI Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies, 2022_

This large-scale study analyzes the relationship between socioeconomic conditions and infectious disease outbreaks worldwide. By examining data from 72 diseases over 23 years, the research identifies significant correlations between 192 socioeconomic indicators and outbreak characteristics. The findings reveal that factors like healthcare access, education levels, employment patterns, and population demographics consistently correlate with specific outbreak types and transmission methods. These insights can enhance disease surveillance systems by incorporating socioeconomic data for more accurate outbreak prediction and targeted public health interventions.

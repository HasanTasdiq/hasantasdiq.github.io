I bridge the gap between quantum theory and scalable systems. Currently pursuing my Ph.D. at UT Arlington (Expecting to graduate in May'2026), I use Deep Reinforcement Learning to solve routing bottlenecks in quantum networks. My research creates adaptive, fidelity-aware algorithms that prioritize real-world throughput, backed by my 3+ years of industry engineering experience

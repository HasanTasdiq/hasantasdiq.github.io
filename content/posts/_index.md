## Bits, Bytes & Life
Exploring LLMs, edge AI, doing projects, reading papers… and the joys of life outside the lab. Some stories come straight from my wife's pen, polished by me.

_**Disclaimer**: This is just a collection of notes -- some parts were generated with a bit of AI help and then cleaned up. A lot of it is mainly for my own reference, so things might be rough or incomplete in places._
